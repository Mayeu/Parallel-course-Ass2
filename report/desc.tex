\chapter{Problem description}

The goal of this assignement is to set up a parallel versions of the quicksort algorithm.

The general algorithm for that is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Select the pivot element
  \item Divide the data into two sets (lower and greater than the pivot)
  \item Recursively call the Quick-sort 
\end{itemize}

We choose to parallelize this algorithm by spawning a new thread each time the data are divided.
